# morse-code-transmitter

This assembly program, designed for the ATmega16A microcontroller, reads a string located at the **MESSAGE** label in the program's memory and outputs it as Morse code. The Morse code signals are transmitted through a speaker connected to Port B, Pin 0 of the microcontroller. This provides a practical example of how Morse code can be implemented and transmitted using low-level assembly programming.
